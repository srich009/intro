LEFTOVERS FROM INTRO TO C++ 

ARC  - supplementary instruction

CS10 - Intro to Programming in C++ I

CS12 - Intro to Programming in C++ II

CS14 - Programming in C++ with Data Structures 

extras - random stuff like: notes, example code, and attempts to fix old labs/programs
        the data structures part probably contains redundant code...

P.S.
these folders contain mostly good code, BUT also unfinished, broken, malfunctioning code && unidentified stuff
